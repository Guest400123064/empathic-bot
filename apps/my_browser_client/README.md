# __Simple Browser Chat__
This is a simple re-implementation of `ParlAI`'s browser chat client using mostly standard library for portability. It also has a simple functionality of collecting chat history.

## __Installation__
Firstly, download (or clone from GitHub) the source files under this folder. In particular, make sure that `main.py` and `_gui.py` are present. If the `chat` folder (storing chat histories) is not created, the script will automatically create one for you.

Next, please manually install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` (which is essentially [`websocket-client`](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
