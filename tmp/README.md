# **Empathic Conversation Study**
​
Thanks for the help! Please follow all of the steps below and this should be a seamless process. There are three main steps,
1. Start a conversation with a chatbot hosted on GCP server. You will be using a simple browser-based client to accomplish this.
2. The chat client will store your chat history with the bot locally, and please upload the history to Google Cloud.
3. After chatting, you will be asked to complete a Qualtrics survey about your experiences with the chatbot.

Detailed instructions are as follows. ​

## __Step One: Chat with the Bot__
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Guest400123064/empathic-bot/tree/main/apps/browser_client) to download the chat service client and interact with the chatbot. The instruction also mentions where is your chat history stored.

__Notes:__
1. __Please remember the ID__ you used to interact with the chatbot. The ID is only used to __match with the Qualtrics survey__ you will fill out shortly afterward.
2. __Please use some unique ID__ that you believe it is very unlikely to coincidentally match that of others. For instance, you can use your school ID or your cool, unique game ID.
3. At some point the client will ask you for an IP address of the chatbot to fill `--host-bot`. This may vary, and please refer to your instructor.
​
## __Step Two: Upload Chat History__
Please upload the conversational data to the shared [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UBtqF_PXoOwkOSvGZrjiBdy_6utJCSrm?usp=sharing).

__Notes:__
1. Suppose your ID is `my_cool_id` and the client folder is `browser_client`. Your chat history should be located at `browser_client/chat/my_cool_id-12_07_18_12.json`, where `12_07_18_12` is the datetime when you carried out the conversation, which may vary. Please upload this `JSON` file.
​
## __Step Three: A Survey about Chat Experience__
**After finishing the conversation**, please fill out the following questions on the [Qualtrics survey](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_26jZ2beozdQrcHk). 

Thats it, thanks for your time and participation!
